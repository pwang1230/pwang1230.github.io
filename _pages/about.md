Hi there! I am a Communication PhD student at Stanford University, supported by a <a href='https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf'>Stanford Graduate Fellowship</a> and a <a href='https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/'>McCoy Ethics Graduate Fellowship</a>. I am advised by <a href='https://profiles.stanford.edu/jeremy-bailenson'>Prof. Jeremy Bailenson</a> at the<a href='https://vhil.stanford.edu/'> Virtual Human Interaction Lab</a>.

I am interested in building up a theoretical framework towards understanding personalized and adaptive immersive technologies. To do this, I hope to develop tools for facilitating social interactions and the creative process in virtual and augmented reality and characterize how individuals and groups utilize these tools over time.

Previously, I completed my M.S. in MS&E at Stanford University and B.S. in Computer Science at Columbia University. While at Columbia, I worked as a research assistant advised by <a href='http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~feiner/'>Prof. Steven Feiner</a> at the <a href='https://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/home'> Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab.
